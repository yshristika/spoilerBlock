# spoilerBlock
Short of implementing a total social media/internet/watercooler chat ban, it can be difficult to avoid seeing spoilers for your favorite TV show… especially if that TV show is as popular as Game of Thrones. Create a browser extension that removes all mentions of your favorite show from any webpage loaded in your browser… or replaces them with cute pictures of puppies.
